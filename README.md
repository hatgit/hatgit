## Cryptography and Open-Source Contributions
In addition to my work in the financial industry, I have a keen interest in researching cryptography and cybersecurity, particularly in relation to the rise of digital assets, web3, blockchain, and their convergence with [AI](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/7be5a16b-00ff-4e4f-9ff4-32334addebbd), and the importance of consumer safety on the internet. In addition to contributing to the [W3C webcrypto](https://github.com/w3c/webcrypto) api and other avanced [cryptographic tools](https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39). I'm also the discoverer of Reversible crypto recovery phrases (i.e. Palindromic Mnemonics) that are BIP-39 compliant, read more [here](https://github.com/hatgit/BIP39-Mnemonic-Tools) and on [my website](https://www.stevenhatzakis.com/crypto/).
